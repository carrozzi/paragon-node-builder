# Healthbot-ova-builder
   The Healthbot OVA is built using Hashicorp Packer with the VMware ISO builder.  I used vmware Fusion in the build process but it should work in Workstation without changes and ESXi with some modification.  
   I went with a desktop product as I found it easier to compact the image size down after building.

   ## Prerequisites
   * Hashicorp [Packer](https://www.packer.io)
   * VMWare Fusion or Workstation(or possibly Player as well as long as you have the VIX API)
   * VMWare OVFtool

## Instructions
1) Download the Centos version of Healthbot(tested with 3.1 and later) as well as the healthbot offline bundle.
2) Place those two files in the hbfiles directory under this one.
3) Make sure ovftool is in your path. It wasn't by default on my Mac.
4) Run ```packer build template.json```. This will take some time.
5) You will find the OVA file in the output-healthbot32-centos7 directory.

## Additional Info
* After I originally posted this, I created two more template files that you can also use
* vboxtemplate.json also builds an OVA but using Virtualbox instead of VMware
* qemutemplate.json builds a qcow2 file for use with KVM/EVE-NG/GNS3/etc
* You are now able to use the OVA file generated by either hypervisor with either one(OVA options are set such that it should not error out)
